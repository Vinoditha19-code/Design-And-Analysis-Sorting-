01. Bubble Sorting:
      This program implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.
      In each pass, adjacent elements are compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order.
      The largest elements "bubble up" to the end of the array after each pass.
      The process repeats until the entire array is sorted.

02. Insertion sorting:
      The provided MATLAB code implements the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.
      It works by iterating through each element, comparing it with the elements before it, and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.
      This results in a fully sorted array by the end of the process.
      The algorithm is simple and efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets, though its average and worst-case time complexity is O(n²).

03. Selection Sorting:
      The code implements the Selection Sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.
      It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array.
      The minimum element is then swapped with the first element of the unsorted portion.
      This process is repeated, shrinking the unsorted part and expanding the sorted part until the entire array is sorted.
      Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n²) in all cases.
      It is simple to implement but inefficient for large datasets compared to more advanced sorting algorithms.
      The algorithm performs well for small arrays and requires no additional memory (in-place sorting).
